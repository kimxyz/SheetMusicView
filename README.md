# Contributing

This is a library that I hope to grow into something that is in a lot better of a state than it is currently in. Some of the features that I hope to add include:

* Better support for the upper half of the notes (so they are not chopped off the way they currently are).
* Multi colored notes.
* The ability to drag and drop notes into the view.
* Making the view look more like a bar and possibly include treble and clef symbols.
* Any other feature that you think would be useful for any user in the future!

This is also the first Android library that I have ever written. If you find some style mistakes or other inefficiencies, please feel free to make a pull request or inform me on how I can make this library better!
